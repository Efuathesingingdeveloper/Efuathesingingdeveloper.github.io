Hello, 

my name is Georgette  Ewuraefua Class-Peters. People call me Efua because that is my middle name as well as my name as an artist.  I am a recent graduate from the University Of Delaware. I am a Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy and  I have a minor in Vocal Performance. My whole life  I have loved music and singing.  A little over two years ago started to make my own music. I would describe my musical genre as R&B/Soul. Through that creative process of becoming an artist and building my brand as a musician, I stumbled upon Software Engineering.  I was looking for a developer to build my website for me and I realized quickly that not only was it pricey, but it was also an amazing skill to have. So while planning for my after-college plans and careers I realized that being a Developer could also be a great way for me to express my creativity while also focusing on my career as a musician. I looked further into it and found the Flatiron School!  I am still extremely new to this and I am not the best yet, but I am sincerely grateful for the experience and I'm happy to be here. Feel free to go support my music! https://efuamusic.com/

, Efua The singing Software Engineering student 
 What can I say ! I'm so so proud of myself !! Two months ago I didn't even know what a local environment was and this week I built my first project which is unbelievable ! The amount of times I cried this week is innumerable ! I had have a huge case of imposter syndrome ! I kept finding myself questioning if I belong in this program or the Tech Field. This week was hard but I have learned so much I feel confident enough to build small CLI Apps now !  What really got me through this week was my unwillingness to give up. I have built, rebuilt, changed and improved upon my app so many times that its crazy. I had immense trouble finding an API I wanted to use because I wanted to make my project music based because that is my biggest passion.  For this project I ended up building a Command Line Interface application based on the Genius API. The app asks the user if they would like to use my app, then they can type in any artist and get a list of the songs by that artist then they can pick a song from the list and get the lyrics for that song in their browser! 
 Learning how to use APIs was such a tough process for me but I'm so amazed that I did it and it worked ! Now onto the next challenge!

Things this application must do == 
#Welcome the user
#ask if they want to use my app,
#ask for an artist, gives them suggestions
#returns a list of artist songs then the lyrics
